      "title": "Grant Thornton US new round of lay offs - Reason: INDUS",
      "content": "I am a salaried employee in the People and culture department (ICS) with perfect evaluation record and was let go today after 3 years. I know of at least 4 more people in my department being laid off. Not sure if its happening in ECS as well. Reasoning: Moving roles to INDUS. My circumstances was very shady. They are doing it 2 weeks before bonus conversations and keeping it hostage unless I stay for a certain amount of time and help their new indus hires with knowledge transfer. They are ruthless. When I joined there was a sense of care about employees and it all went to shit after their mountain capital deal.\n\nUpdate: Just a clarification I am not in HR. I was in Learning technology and helped train Audit, Advisory and sometimes tax people, lots of intern programs and also fundemantal knowledge trainings (SAP, Tax code, all the software they use). Rolled out 100s of trainings. I am a tech guy and a power user in a lot of software they use thats why they want me to train their new peeps.",

      "title": "Pitt Is Launching a Chiropractic Program—What Happens When Pseudoscience Gets an Academic Seal of Approval?",
      "content": "Hi all,\nI'm a physical therapist who works in interdisciplinary care and values evidence-based practice. I wanted to raise a concern that I believe impacts not just PTs, but all of us in medicine, especially those involved in education and patient advocacy.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh, a highly respected institution in allied health and medical research, recently announced the launch of a Doctor of Chiropractic program. While this might appear to be an effort to expand interprofessional education, it raises major concerns around an academic institution platforming pseudoscientific practices, including subluxation theory, spinal manipulation for non-MSK conditions, and anti-vaccine rhetoric, all of which remain common in the chiropractic field.\n\nHere’s why this matters for physicians and the future of healthcare:\n\nIt risks legitimizing pseudoscience under respected academic brands. Even if Pitt teaches to the highest academic standards internally, once these graduates are licensed, they gain access to continuing education units (CEUs) that are not held to the same standards. That includes CEUs on infant spinal manipulation, “clinical detoxing,” subluxation theory, and anti-vax messaging; and they'll be promoting this under the reputation of a top-tier academic institution.\n\nIt erodes public trust in science-backed providers. Patients may confuse DCs trained at Pitt with other clinicians who follow rigorous medical models, leading to misinformation, mixed messages, and distrust in legitimate providers like MDs, DOs, PAs, and PTs.\n\nIt sets a dangerous precedent. If Pitt, a flagship institution, launches a DC program without clear reform or regulatory safeguards, it opens the door for other less rigorous academic centers to follow, further blurring the line between science and pseudoscience.\n\n\nThis isn't about professional gatekeeping, it’s about protecting patients and ensuring that academic medicine doesn’t lend credibility to unregulated, unscientific practices. Quackery isn't just silly, it delay legitimate care and hurts patient outcomes. \n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts:\n\nShould national organizations (AMA, AAMC, APTA) be weighing in?\n\nWhat responsibility does an academic institution have when legitimizing a profession still steeped in pseudoscience?\n\n\nIf you're concerned too, I’ve created a petition and would appreciate your feedback or support:\n👉 https://chng.it/qJGrWxx5Sx\n\nThanks for reading—and for everything you do to uphold the integrity of medical care.",

This puts the company ahead of early rises such as Apple and Microsoft and makes it the first company to reach the four trillion dollar milestone.\n\nEarlier this year NVIDIA took a dive as people questioned its value in the AI market, especially with DeepSeek promoting AI models on less expensive hardware. Now it's back up and at record highs, both for the market and the company.\n\nDo you think we'll see NVIDIA climb higher, or is the shine starting to wear off the AI bubble?",

Looking at the current administration's actions, the trade deficits, and our sovereign debt levels, the USD must weaken.   How to short the USD? (Do I short UUP or go long puts UUP, or long a forex pair like CAD/USD OR EU/USD?)\n2. LT USG bonds will rise in yield. How to short LT USG bonds? (Do I short TLT or go long puts TLT?) \n3. Thus, housing market will soften substantially.  How to short that? (Really stumped on this one.  Do I go short a MREIT like NLY?)\n4. When Jerome Powell is replaced, which he will be, and sooner or later the front end of the curve will go down.  Short term rates will lower.  How to profit on that?  (Also stumped on this one.  Do I go short SGOV or TFLO?  Or do I need a product with more duration like up to what...3 yrs?)",

I have ~$10k emergency fund in my HYSA, which has offered on average 3.6% APY per month over the past year and a half. 1 month T-Bills however have almost consistently been over 4% APY. Would you guys recommend just investing directly from my HYSA into 1 month T-Bills to utilize the higher APY? I’ve done it once or twice but I’m hesitant to make it a regular thing since obviously when the payment gets made to the Treasury I won’t have the money anymore, and I can’t really demand it back, which kind of defeats the point of an emergency fund. But I want to utilize that higher APY, if possible. Any suggestions?",

I would like to take it into my own hands.\n\nWould the series 65 be a good start? I had thought about SlE exam.. but I studied finance and it's all pretty high level info. I had thought a few years back in college that I would want to be an advisor. I would pay out of pocket to get the 65 exam prep + test. They most likely won't sponsor me.\n\nAny thoughts? \n\nI know I could job hop, but I don't know where I want to go or do, hoping certs could open my eyes + possibly boost my earning potential? Maybe I'm not thinking correctly.",

      "content": "I’m just wondering what’s the best practice here - for speculative investments (such as HOOD), would you put them in Roth IRA or a non-retirement brokerage account? Should Roth IRA just hold index funds for long-term growth or should it hold the more aggressive investments to take full advantage of the tax advantages? I find myself most actively managing my non-retirement account (because it’s much bigger) and just letting my Roth IRA sit there with index funds like VTI and VOO, while I have stocks like HOOD, TSLA, BITO, etc in my non-retirement brokerage where I do more transactions there. Should I be doing the opposite? Like do index funds in non-retirement account and aggressive investments in Roth IRA?",

My core business idea is what I'm passionate about, but it feels like I spend 80% of my day just trying to manage the *business of the business*.\n\nMy current \"stack\" is a chaotic mess of Google Docs for plans, another tool for social media, a CRM that I barely understand, accounting software, and a dozen other small subscriptions. It feels like I'm paying hundreds of dollars a month just for the privilege of being disorganized and stressed out.\n\nI’m at a point where I'm questioning if this level of operational chaos is just the \"cost of doing business\" or if I'm doing something fundamentally wrong.

      "title": "Today I made $1m gains by selling my entire Nvidia portfolio",
      "content": "Today marks perhaps my greatest investing milestone of all time!  The short story is I bought $36,000 worth of Nvidia over the course of 8 years. Last year I told myself once my account breaks $1m profit, I will sell the entire position, lock in the gains, and have a hell of a story to share for life.  Well today Nvidia hit a new all time high and I made that dream come true.\n\nBelow is a long version of how it all came to be: \n\nI first acquired Nvidia back in Feb 2017 and in a few lump sum purchases wound up with a total of 6,500 shares of NVDA.  My first purchase was for 1080 (in honor of my GTX 1080 I bought that year) and the share price at the time was a whopping $2.77!  My total investment around this time was $4000.  \n\nBack in 2017 all the talk was about Crypto mining and I naively thought Nvidia was the way Bitcoin would be mined forever so I bought into the mantra “during a gold rush, buy the company selling the shovels”.  This was around the time BTC hit $20,000 for the first time but it quickly collapsed and I was introduced into the volatility of the crypto world.  But I still held my Nvidia because I believed crypto was still at an early adoption stage.  \n\nOver the next few years I continued to buy small amounts of Nvidia, in chunks of 100 shares here, 900 shares here, and eventually had 6,000 shares by 2019.  The average cost of all of these were around $2-$8 in today’s value.  \n\n2019 is a significant milestone for me because I made a major life decision to move to Puerto Rico. \n\nI remember somewhere around 2019-2020 starting to think that GPUs and Nvidia specifically weren’t going to be tied to crypto as much as it would be the hardware needed to power self driving cars.  The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs.  So my mentality moved from Crypto to Electric Vehicles.  Keep in mind, I really didn’t know a lot about any of this and I view my Nvidia convictions at the time more as luck looking back.  \n\nThen in 2020 the Pandemic hit and we saw major sales of GPUs for gaming, virtual reality, and supply chain disruption and of course massive inflation.  Stocks across the board were super volatile but in general things went bonkers in the tech sector.  Tesla was killing it and Nvidia might have doubled during this time.  It still had not gone parabolic yet but I still just kept holding onto my initial position.  My portfolio wasn’t really moving in any major way yet and in early 2019 I was actually slightly negative in my total Nvidia investment.  \n\nThen in 2023 we saw the first mainstream use cases for Ai started popping up.  I’m in the photography and videography world so I noticed how disruptive image and video creation would be as soon as it hit.  All my colleagues were making images in Midjourney when the majority of my non photo friends had no clue what Ai image generation even was.  It ballooned quickly and that’s when my mind set changed a third time. Now Nvidia was going to be needed for data centers and personal computers to power this new Ai revolution.  It wasn’t about crypto or self driving cars anymore, it was about perhaps the biggest innovation humanity has seen since the internet was launched and the iPhone was revealed.  \n\nSeemingly overnight my portfolio was sky rocking.  Where just a few years prior, Nvidia was in the red for me, it quickly started carving out a large portion of my portfolio.  Once a liability, Nvidia now made up 10%, 20%, and 30% of my entire investment account and retirement funds.  There were days when I would log in to see I had made $100,000 that day and a week later it would swing down -$105,000.  It was pretty crazy to see a full year’s worth of income bouncing around day by day in my account.  The temptation to sell had always been there since 2017 when I was up 20-100% but now I was up 4,000% and the temptation was even greater.  Every single one of my friends was telling me I had to take profits off the table.  I wound up holding.  \n\nThe last major purchase I made was in July 2021. I bought 400 shares for $14 which at the time was 3-5x what I had bought previously.  \n\nJump to June 2024 when Nvidia hit an all time high of $130.  My wife and I had just had our first child and my Nvidia position was hovering around $800,000 in total gains.  I knew I only had to make it to $160 per share to break the $1m mark and I told myself I would sell everything if that happened.  Of course the next month Nvidia corrected pretty hard and the reality of hitting $160 didn’t seem possible until July 3rd 2025, nearly a year after I made my original decision to sell.  \n\nI should have sold everything on July 3rd but I didn’t realize the trading day was shortened for the 4th of July holiday coming up. I also didn’t setup any automated sell triggers since I wanted to ceremoniously do the trade myself.  It worked out in my favor as I was able to sell today at $163 and make a little more than the $1m cutoff I originally set to sell at. \n\nHere are the raw numbers:\n\nTotal invested: $36,352\nTotal sale: $1,059,591\nTotal gains: $1,023,238\nAverage cost per share: $5.60\nTime to materialize: 8 years and a lot of emotional rollercoasters!\n\n\nI know a lot of people get caught up in fancy investment options that feels more like gambling but hopefully this success story inspires those of you who are like me and just what to buy shares, hold them, and eventually offload them when the time seems right.  \n\n",

I said screw it and sent a resignation email to my manager. \n\nNow that my back was against the wall and i had no other option. \n\ni went to the drawing board and tried to analyze what was the common sauce in brands which grew immensely vs which failed.\n\nThe brands built on hype or a trend miserably failed whereas brands built on insecurity and lust did great.\n\nHaving worked with Fashion and Personal Care brands of all sized. I was sure it had to be one of this two categories.\n\nWhile clothing was an inventory nightmare my obvious choice was to build a skincare brand.\n\nI took help from a contract manufacturer who used to build for one of my clients before. \n\nI launched a clean no bs beauty brand for women’s with minimalist packaging and a clear messaging.\n\nNow comes the most important part - Distribution.\n\nI was always bullish on Community and UGC content from my past experiences.\n\nOur gtm was giving free samples to female micro influencers (<1K followers) to try and post videos on their instagram in exchange of which I promised them to run ads on their reels giving them visibility. We onboarded over 500+ small and medium influencers. \n\nWe were all over the place. We saw over 100K+ users coming on our website in the first three month,\n\nAnother thing that gave us great results was having a mobile app for our store from the start. I saw it before too, brands with mobile apps had 2-3X higher conversions and 15-20% higher vs mobile web.\n\nWeirdly we saw 4X higher conversion and 60% of revenue on our app.\n\nThe only sauce here was we were giving Flat 20% on the app on first order and a free moisturizer sample $29 worth on every order above $50.\n\nWe are net positive with 16% margins even after all the discounts and free gifts.\n\nA significant part of our revenue now comes from subscriptions and the first party data collected from the app helps us with better retargeting on meta.\n\nTLDR;\n\nI have made 3X more money in the last one year than I did in the last 5 years combined.\n\nIf you’re stuck chasing the next gen product take a step back and build something boring that satisfies women’s hunger for beauty or man’s lust or insecurity. You'll make money 9/10 chances. ",

      "content": "A recent Stanford study revealed that 41% of YC companies are automating tasks that no one wants automated. \n\nPersonally, I believe this number is much higher outside of YC and demonstrates a blind spot of Silicon Valley hype.\n\nA few theories as to why this is the case:\n\n1.) YC market to left-brained, younger founders, and these younger founders lack industry expertise (and sometimes creative thinking skills).  \n\n2.) YC primarily prefer technical founders. who often have a bias in thought towards “how can I build this?” as opposed to “how can this make money AND realistically fit into the existing user experience AND factor in human elements of the experience.” The problem(s) they go after, the product they build, and their outlook on UX often leads to them missing more human details.\n\n3.) YC media content pushes mainly “build AI  now” propaganda to their university-based audience withe low to minimal work experience. So it’s completely understandable how they fall into trap of inadvertently automating tasks people actually enjoy doing. \n\nCustomer: *has 500 daily data entries*\n\nAI startup: “We’ll automate your client relationship calls for you!”\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "content": "So I work in a Sales position in the e-commerce department of a large hydraulics distributor.  A little while ago I built a tool that scrapes our biggest competitors e-commerce storefront twice a day, dumps that data to a DB and then serves that up on a nice dashboard behind authentication.   Dashboard allows you to select a date range to filter by and displays the estimated revenue for the time period, a paginated table with every single part and its price, quantity sold, restocked, current quantity on hand etc.  You can also filter it by column and export the entire thing to excel.  It also shows the top 10 sold and top 10 restock units.\n\nAnyways over time this data is going to prove very valuable to the company because it will allow them to adjust stock purchases to match what the competitor is selling.  \n\nAnyways jump to today and my boss comes in my office...  he goes on to say that it would make more sense to have the dashboard and database be served on an \"internal\" server and goes on to talk about my hiring contract and the restrictive covenant clause.  He says that anything I build on company time even if on my own PC is owned by the company.  I scoffed and said I dont remember seeing anything like that and low and behold when I go check all it says is I cant sell or solicit to any of the companies clients for 1 year after I leave.  So no.  The cynic in me feels he wants to get rid of me because I have just started a divorce process and he feels like im a burden needing time to handle things.  But the worst part is I dont want to give away this system for free seeing as how valuable to them it will be.\n\nIm looking for advice on how people here would handle this if they were in the same situation.\n\nThanks!",

      "title": "Take over wife’s family business?",
      "content": "I’m trying to decide what to do. My father in law owns 1/3rd of a sizable (~$50 million ish) revenue business. He called me yesterday out of the blue and said he has been thinking about how to exit the business and wanted to know if I’d be interested in working there for 3 years before buying him out over 10 years on a seller note. Debt and terms I’d never get from a bank.\n\nAdditional context, Im 29 and my wife and two children (<2yo) and I live a thousand miles away from the business in a place we really love. We have a community and feel really at home here. We don’t want to move our family and our lives back to my wife’s hometown.\n\nBut I can’t shake the feeling that this is an opportunity of a lifetime. My FIL takes like 16 weeks of vacations a year, the business does net profit in the 5%-7% range (2.5M-3.5M net profit) and employs about 150 people. This is a real business, not the “buying a job” stuff you see on here all the time. Two of the three owners only come in for quarterly board meetings. My goal would be to grow it and really put some energy into it, so I wouldn’t be taking that amount of vacation and would treat it like my full time job + a lot.\n\nI’m really torn about overvaluing our community and home here and passing up a clear path to significant wealth in the next 15 years. Some back of the napkin math excluding any business growth has us at like $6m net worth by 40 if we do this.\n\nI know it wont be easy but I’ve wanted to own a business and this would give us a high likelihood of accruing life changing wealth. We wouldn’t be miserable there, but the winters suck and would have to rebuild friend groups which is hard especially in a small town.\n\nWhat would you do? Take a shot on yourself to provide your family wealth and the freedom that comes with it for a short term quality of life hit? Or stick where I am, perfectly fine upper middle class life, but unlikely to accrue more than say $5-$6M by retirement age.\n\nIf you are still with me I appreciate it. TLDR is money really that great? I can’t think of what I’d even spend that kind of money on.\n\nEDIT: thank you everyone for your constructive and occasionally demeaning feedback. 😂 As someone pointed out in the comments we are in the “Should we look into this more closely” phase. I only have rough verbal financials from FIL but they seem realistic. I’m not about to sign anything or move cross country without significant due diligence. Which I’m actually prepared to conduct due to a prior experience at an employer that was purchased and significant personal research. Based on all your feedback I’ll take the next step and get more details. I had a lingering feeling that building life changing wealth is worth taking a chance on and that was validated here. We will see if the deal gets done. Thank you all.",

      "content": "I will not promote.\n\nA lot of people launch startups because they’re chasing freedom. No boss, no rules, just you building something on your own terms. That’s the dream.\n\nHere’s the punchline: for most founders, the search for freedom turns into a new kind of cage.\n\nFirst, you realize you need cash. Investors seem like the ticket out. But taking money is signing up for a new job, except now your boss is a board of directors, a stack of investor agreements and quarterly calls where you get grilled for not growing 3x every six months.\n\nYou’ll hear VCs talk about \"keeping founders motivated\" which is translated like \"don’t pay yourself much\", \"don’t sell your shares\", \"don’t stop grinding. You work 80 hour weeks, raise round after round and slowly watch your own stake shrink.\n\nHere’s the math nobody talks about:  \n\\- After years of burn, you finally sell for $40M  \n\\- Your slice? Maybe 10-15%, after dilution  \n\\- That’s $4-6M, pre-tax, for 5-7 years of stress, late nights and feeling like you’re never doing enough\n\nBreak it down, and the \"big exit\" doesn’t look so glamorous. You might have made the same or more running a cashflow business, with less stress and total freedom.\n\nVenture funding only makes sense if you’re truly building something massive where even a small slice is life changing. For most, the \"freedom\" pitch is just another trap. If you want real independence, build something profitable, keep your options open and run it on your terms.\n\nFreedom > hype. And if you’re chasing the money, at least do the math honestly.",

Our kids, they’re still small so college/university is years away.\n\nI’m approaching 40 in a few years and feel like I’m running out of time to do what I love full time and be my own boss.\n\nHave gone as far as telling my employer I’m quitting to only back down a week later. Almost hoping for a layoff but that may never happen. The current economic uncertainty doesn’t help (I’m Canadian).\n\nWhat are some of your advice on this?",

I didn't get to work on it as much as I would have wanted due to burnout, but I hope next year I'll start fresh. For now I'm taking it easy (I have a full time job) and only doing maintenance on it and some small fixes.\n\nI just feel so proud of this project, still making money even though I haven't launched any major features in a while. Just goes to show that the idea is solid and it's actually helping people.\n\nI have an endless list of things I want to develop further, but I've also learned recently that I have to be patient, not everything has to be build in 1 week.",

      "content": "I run a small dev and marketing agency with three people. Recently, we reached out to a potential client who had already spoken with several other agencies. She even had meetings with some after talking to us. Some of those agencies offered lower prices and quicker turnarounds.\n\nStill, she decided to work with us.\n\nWhen I asked her why, she said something that really stuck with me. She told me that she wanted more than just someone to build a product and walk away after the money was paid. She wanted a partner who truly cared about her vision and was invested in her long-term success.\n\nFrom our first conversation, I made sure to listen carefully. Instead of pushing a sales pitch, I focused on understanding her goals and the challenges her business was facing. I shared honest advice and suggestions, not to sell but because I genuinely wanted to help.\n\nThat connection made the difference. She trusted that we were there to work alongside her, not just deliver a one-time project.\n\nSince then, our collaboration has been smooth and rewarding. She values our input and we continue to help her grow her brand over time.\n\nThis experience reminded me why I do this work. For a small team like ours, it is not about the highest price or the fastest deal. It is about building trust, understanding what really matters to our clients, and helping them succeed in the long run.",

It took time, but I built a steady customer base without spending a dime on ads. I think too many people assume you need a big budget to get started, but organic growth is underrated.

After that I bounced around a little bit trying different accounting roles. I’m currently an internal auditor at a public company. At every job I’ve had I’ve had pretty severe imposter syndrome, anxiety, and overall low self confidence in myself and my work. I constantly compare myself to others and see how much better/smarter/driven they are. I don’t like speaking up in meetings or in general because of the fear that I will sound ignorant to my peers. I just constantly find myself in a spiral of negative thoughts. All of this and I’ve never had any negative comments from superiors. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me… Although I’m sure I can trace some of these issues back to my childhood and how I was raised. \n\nAnyway, I’m just curious if anyone else has similar issues within accounting, audit, business, or life in general. Or maybe it’s just me and I need severe help. ",

Apparently they denied the request because the procedure *could* be done with a laser, which the insurance company considers to be investigational and not within the current standard of care. I tell them I have no intention of using a laser, none of my notes mention anything about using a laser, and they approved the procedure. \n\nThis is clearly just obstructionism at its finest. What will they claim next? Oh, we denied your request to put ear tubes in a kid because maybe you might try to do it using the robot and we consider that investigational.",

Today I worked on something all day just to find out it was entirely wrong 😭😭😭 (this is after asking clarifying questions too it was just miscommunication). The staff was so nice about it and everything and already said how nothing was even really expected from me but damn. I feel like a toddler 😭. I did however learn what is expected of me now if this assignment is given to me again though lmao. ",

            "description": "Startup founders consistently struggle to find relevant investors and secure warm introductions, which are often cited as the most effective way to raise funds. Existing methods like LinkedIn searches, Google, and cold outreach are inefficient, time-consuming, and yield low success rates. The reliance on personal networks for 'warm intros' creates a significant barrier for many founders, leading to frustration and delays in critical fundraising efforts.",
            "currentSolution": null,
            "proposedSolution": "An AI-powered investor matching and warm introduction platform. Founders would input detailed startup information (industry, stage, funding needs, traction, team, deck). The AI would then match them with highly relevant investors (VCs, angels, family offices) based on investment thesis, portfolio, and stage preference. Crucially, the platform would identify and suggest optimal 'warm intro' paths through shared connections (e.g., mutual advisors, previous employers, university alumni) and facilitate the introduction request, significantly de-risking and streamlining the fundraising process.",
            "marketContext": "Fundraising remains a critical bottleneck for many promising startups, and the reliance on 'warm intros' often creates an uneven playing field. An AI solution that democratizes access to relevant investors and efficiently facilitates genuine connections could be transformative for the startup ecosystem.",
            "implementationNotes": "Requires an extensive and constantly updated database of investors and their networks, sophisticated graph databases for connection mapping, and advanced AI for matching. Building trust with both founders and potential introducers is paramount, necessitating strong privacy controls for network data.",

I have to believe there are thousands of business owners in the same boat as me. \n\nI import product from a country (not China or Asia) that is going to be hit with a 30% tariff.  We are not talking about 30% on a $3 item.  We are talking  30% on one item that would cost $5000.  Our current pricing is at market pricing. Basically we are selling for the same amount US manufacturers are selling, maybe even more in some cases. \n\nThe 30% is a death sentence for this product in the US.  It will price it right out of the market.  So I get a small commission on every sale... But that will be gone.  I was set to earn close to $200k on commissions in 2025.  Gone.  That is $200k I am not spending on business trips, home renovations, eating out, paying taxes (state and local included). I was about to hire someone to help with the business as well.  It's all on hold. \n\nHow does this make sense?  I am just one business, I have to believe there are thousands of others in the same situation.  If so, it really has to start affecting the economy really soon. \n\nFYI - my business partner voted for Trump, FAFO, right? I don't even talk to him about it, it pisses me off so much.  I can tell he feels like an idiot for supporting Trump. ",

      "content": "My husband and I have owned a business together for about 10 years. We've built it from the ground up, and with the help of a staff have created a really awesome community. \n\nSince creating the business, we've also had a child, and that has meant our focus has had to shift. The business has continued to grow, but it can't be our \"baby\" in the same way anymore.\n\nWe've recently had two employees approach us about buying into the business and being owners alongside us. I think they are ultimately worried that we are going to close the place down and don't want to lose the community. While growing our family and owning the place has been stressful, the business is also our livelihood and we don't have any immediate plans of closing it (who knows what the future will bring).\n\nMy husband likes the idea, because they would bring a lot to the table and be able to shoulder some of the things that he and I don't like doing. He's also entertaining the idea of profit sharing as an alternative.\n\nI don't disagree, but I'm not wild about the idea of sharing the decision making, or even sharing ownership in something that I've worked really hard to co-create, even though I really like and respect the employees who approached us.\n\nLooking for some opinions on the above. Is it ever a good idea to open up sharing ownership in a small family business with employees? Can it work? Is profit sharing better? I'm not even sure of the right questions to ask, but would love any thoughts you all might have. Thanks! ",

I’ve been spending the last few months learning how to monetize simple skills using just my phone and WiFi.\nIt started with curiosity, a few sleepless nights, and a lot of trial and error but now I’ve made a bit of money using free tools like Canva, Notion, Gumroad, and Reddit itself.\nRecently I realized that we often overlook the smallest skills that could make us money if we leaned into them more: things like creating Notion templates, writing product descriptions, organizing info, or just knowing what to Google. \nSo here’s what I’m curious about....What’s one “small” skill you learned or practiced that ended up helping you make actual money even if it wasn’t sexy or glamorous? Whether it’s flipping items, setting up automation, editing something for someone, or something niche... I’d love to hear. Let’s build a thread that helps people see what skills are really working out here 🙏\n",

      "content": "I’m in my mid 20’s with just around 400k in unrealized gains for my Individual Brokerage account. A Fidelity rep reached out to me and pitched the idea of a tax loss harvesting SMA. \n\nIt seemed very convincing where it essentially tracks the S&P but harvest tax losses so if I wanted to sell some of my positions, it would offset those losses. Meanwhile, the fund itself continues to go up just as the S&P would.\n\nThis is how I understand it and it seems too good to be true but I wanted to see if anybody had any experience with it. The advisory fee would likely be .4% with minimum 100k buy in.\n\nIs it worth it to buy into one of these accounts and harvest losses so I can sell some of my individual brokerage positions or should I just continue to invest in the S&P?  I have no other way to lower my taxes if I were to ever sell these positions.",

      "content": "Been investing in stocks for the last 13 years. I recently calculated my returns and my CAGR is approximately 20% over 12 years. The S&P500 was 12% during the same period. \n\nI hit on some big winners like AAPL, CMG and NET. I held a very concentrated portfolio. Early on I was 70% AAPL. Then I diversified into more companies to lower risk. \n\nI’m thinking of quitting stocks and just going all in ETF. It takes a considerable amount of time to research and keep up with a dozen or so companies. And something is telling me I got damn lucky. \n\nIf I continue to strongly out perform the market the next 5-10 years it could make a big difference. But I could also get crushed for having a highly concentrated portfolio. I don’t like to hold more than 20 or so companies. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation and just cashed in your chips and went 100% etf? \n\nAt this point I don’t really enjoy the grind of investing in individual stocks. It is purely for profit. \n\nDid think about going mostly etf and some stocks. But won’t make much sense since it will take just as much time to do research on a smaller stock portfolio ",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I just wanted to vent a bit and see if others have dealt with something similar.\n\nI work at a small local accounting firm in a rural Midwest town. We’ve got six accountants, none of whom are CPAs — including the owner. It’s an S Corp structure, and the “owner” functions more like a fractional CFO. He’s never actually worked in accounting before starting the firm. He’s one of those guys who majored in Finance going to a small school and it never worked out for him.\n\nWe each have extra responsibilities beyond basic bookkeeping (payroll, marketing, taxes, etc.). Out of the 5 employees (excluding the owner), 2 recently put in their notice — one had been here for five years.\n\nHere’s what frustrates me:\n\t•\tNo benefits whatsoever: no PTO, no health insurance, no holiday pay.\n\t•\tAll paid hourly at very low rates — I make $16/hr.\n\t•\tNo raises — ever. We don’t have a typical structure of “senior associate”, “manager” or anything. Everyone’s on the same level which is BS in my opinion. Even senior employees don’t get raises though.\n\t•\tNo incentive or encouragement to get a degree, CPA, or grow professionally. He actually told one of our long time employees who wanted to go back to school that it wasn’t worth it and she didn’t need it despite her trying to branch out from a job that severely underpays her. \n\t•\tZero culture of development — just “get the work done” and make the owner money.\n\t•\tHe seems to train people just to do more work cheaply, not to build a strong firm or succession plan.\n\nI’m a college student one semester away from graduating and I’ve accepted an internship at RSM, so I do have a path out. I just feel stuck now because I’m also the sole provider for my girlfriend and our son. I work 25–30 hours at the firm and another 10 as a server, where I make triple the money in fewer hours.\n\nI really want to quit the firm, but I don’t want to raise any red flags with RSM before starting. So I’m considering just pushing through the next 5 months until the internship starts.\n\nHas anyone else worked in a place like this? How did you deal with it? Is it worth quitting early if you’re burning out, or should I just ride it out?\n\nAppreciate any advice or stories.\n",

      "content": "I'll go first - I'm just a med student, but we take IM call during 3rd year where I am.\n\nI got called at 4:30 AM after a very exhausting night helping the resident stabilize a sick patient until about midnight. The reason? A patient with a history of chronic constipation was constipated again. This was less than 3 hours before the day team came on. And no, they didn't give the ordered PEG.\n\nAs medical students, we can't refuse consults and have to consult the resident too. So not only did I have to see the patient, write a note, which took an hour, but I had to wake up the resident too.",

I fucking hate it.\n\nI'm one of those people who can't even bring myself to upvote my own posts. Like seriously, I'll post something and then immediately close the tab because I can't stand looking at it.\n\nThe whole thing feels so fake and performative. All these \"thought leaders\" posting their humble brags and inspirational quotes... ugh.\n\nBut apparently this is how you're supposed to succeed now? Just constantly posting about yourself?\n\nSo for those of you who also hate this shit:\n\n- ⁠how do you actually feel about having to promote yourself? does it make you want to die inside too?\n- have you found any ways to do it that don't feel completely soul-crushing?\n- did you get over the anxiety somehow or do you just power through feeling like crap?\n- is there actually another way to grow a business without becoming a linkedin influencer?\n\nI'm starting to think maybe I'm just not cut out for this whole entrepreneur thing if I can't even handle basic self-promotion. But there's gotta be other people who feel this way right?\n\nanyone else just want to build cool stuff without having to be a marketing machine?",

Manager has not given me any new work. I have nothing to do. \n\nOnce upon a time manager say if you need extra work lmk so I try and say this. She busy and stressed, she have me shadow other team member but I cant do those persons tasks because I dont have the access level in the order system being used to pull and edit all the data. Manager know this.\n\nManager get grumpy when I say I dont have enough stuff to keep me busy for 40 hours, complain she busy, I say I can help with anything just let me know, but she just keep saying I have things to do, little projects… no not really bro.\n\nOh why not just shut up and act busy?\n\nTHEY FKN PRODUCTIVITY TRACK US. \n\nHow tf am I supposed to randomly click around a blank excel for 8 hours over and over and over and over with the paranoia of knowing any gaps in clicking they will be like what are you doing? Why not work? WHY NOT GIVE ME WORK?\n\nIve been trying ti be chill and proactive because I dont want to get fired, my applications arent getting any call backs, and I’m still 7+ months out from being CPA eligible so I just feel stuck and like I’m damned if I do and damned if I don’t. \n\n",

I was a very early employee (first 10) and am near the top of the org chart.\n\nWe recently closed a large funding round, and our revenue is growing.\n\nThe issue is – I am burnt out. The stress has taken a toll on my physical and mental health. I thought I could tough it out, but it seems to get harder with each week. I know I need to leave at some point soon, for the sake of myself and my family.\n\nIn the lead up to funding, I was given strong signals that sales via a secondary would be available, but unfortunately this was only the case for the founder. Obviously this was very disappointing to myself.\n\nI have been here for over 7 years, and am not sure if I can make it another 2 until the next potential round (if there is one at all) or to some unknown liquidity event. My ideal scenario would be a clean break from the company including liquidation of my stock.\n\nI have a decent amount of equity (not a founder sized grant, but fourth on the cap table) and it is fully vested and fully early exercised. The cash value of the equity based on our 409a based FMV is over 2M, The equity value based on the round is over 10M. Either way, this is life changing money for me.\n\nWhat leverage, if any, do I have when leaving?\n\nWould it be possible to sell back my shares to the company at FMV on the way out?\n\nWould it make more sense to leave completely amicably, and then reach out to the founder or the investors directly to buy me out at FMV?\n\nI thought about 3rd party sales, but the company has the right of first refusal. Does anyone have experience with this, I can imagine it’s likely easiest to just deny the sale outright?\n\nI know the common advice is to talk to a lawyer, which I will, but if you could provide advice on what kind of lawyer I am looking for that would be very helpful.",

They lack clear paths for secondary sales, are unsure about their leverage, and need guidance on legal and financial aspects (e.g., company's right of first refusal, valuation discrepancies). The core problem is the illiquidity and complexity of exiting with vested startup equity.",

The platform would: 1) Provide AI-driven valuation insights (based on 409a, recent funding rounds, and market comparables). 2) Facilitate secure connections between sellers and potential buyers (institutional investors, funds, or even the company itself). 3) Offer AI-assisted guidance on navigating legal complexities like Right of First Refusal (ROFR) and generating initial transaction documents. 4) Provide strategic advice on optimal timing and negotiation tactics based on market data. This would streamline the entire exit process, offering a 'clean break' and maximizing liquidity.",

Quit and decided to start some software company (didn't have a problem space at the time nor am I a domain expert in anything - but thought I can figure it out)\n3. Some time passed and still couldn't figure out a problem space, and I realized building the software itself is not my thing. I realized I enjoy being the domain expert, not the knee-deep technical guy in building out solutions.\n4. Got interested in AI automation using n8n.\n5. Started pitching my solution and providing free automations for a few clients\n6. Have been doing that till now (just 2 months in) - but a common theme I see amongst my clients is that the solution is a NICE TO HAVE solution, not a painpoint.\n7. Losing confidence in AI automation agency as a business model in where I live.\n8. An anology is there are 2 kind of gym trainers: 1) the type that the moment you see them, you know they are devoted to their craft; 2) those that gets a cert just so they can get a job in a gym... I feel like I am the latter when it comes to AI automation agency\n9. So now I am figuring out my next steps. I know that I lack both domain and technical expertise. I want to get domain expertise.\n10. My options are: i. Join a good startup and learn the ways to run one - and hopefully identify a problem space that I am interested in solving during that time. ii. Continue what I'm doing in AI automation - dont give up because so far I have realized none of my visions that I have set for myself when quitting my full time job, and keep talking to customers and exploring other opportunities that I won't have domain expertise in.\n\nFor those who have went through something similar, would really appreciate your advice.

      "content": "So I'm a cofounder of a startup. One of the cofounder has another day time job and is the CEO of the company (He is a first time founder and does not have a business background). He contributes about 12 hours a week while I am in the company full time, the equity reflects this difference in time contribution.\n\nSo here is where I have a problem: his contributions of the company is pretty much taking meetings and delegating all tasks to anyone that's near him. For example, outsources customer discovery to an intern, outsources business plan to advisor, outsources regulatory compliance to part time worker with no experience, and me (the tech guy) has talked to more VCs. His 12 hours a week is just spent being updated by these people around him... this can't be normal for a 4 person startup company right? I feel like I'm personally building the product, understanding customer needs and promoting our product... my life would be much easier if I could just take internal meetings....\n\nAm I not meant to work in a startup? I just feel a certain unfairness in this relationship... What should the CEO be doing in his 12 hours a week?\n\n  \nEdit: Thx people, I'm exiting this startup at the years end.",

If there was an app where you make a short 30-second pitch video about yourself with *no resumes, no job history,* just what drives you, what problems you want to solve, etc...\n   * Would you do it?\n   * Would you be open to getting matched with someone based on shared values/ambitions (instead of credentials)?\n\nCurious if anyone else is feeling this shift or if I’m just delusional😂",

      "content": "I have a product. It’s really an invention so not just selling what others already have. I’m a SAHM and have no income so it would be completely funded by my husband. I have done the following:\n\n1. Drafted Product\n2. Had Product Made (Alibaba)\n3. Tested 3 Versions over a year\n4. Posted on TikTok ONCE for user interest (38 likes and 4 comments - 1 of which was “I need this”)\n5. Created a website\n\nI really believe in my idea but my husband is meh about it. When I bring it up he doesn’t really elaborate on the idea of expanding it much. I would like to order 50 units which would be $1000 to have them made and shipped overseas to the US (made in China). He would rather me do a pre-order which I feel is pointless. The item itself is a toddler sleep solution so it’s one that parents would likely buy as a “right now” purchase rather than a pre-order purchase. Drop shipping is an option, but that cuts my profits from $70 an item to $30 an item. \n\nHow do I get him to fund a bulk order? Maybe start with a few (costs double)?? Do the drop shipping option and ask to order more later?? Perhaps he needs to see traction. \n\nFor financial reference, we clear 300k annually with his job and own 2 homes (1 we rent out) so it’s not a money thing. It feels like maybe he doesn’t believe in the idea. I wish he would just say that instead of being weird about it. When I ask him he says it’s a good idea but doesn’t know if others will think the same. \n\nIdk, how would you sway your spouse?",

Curate & Simplify: Analyze startup pitches and financial data to present simplified, digestible investment opportunities tailored to retail investors' risk profiles and interests. 2. Aggregate & Manage: Facilitate the aggregation of small investments into larger, manageable tranches for startups. 3. Risk Assessment & Education: Provide AI-driven risk assessments and educational content for retail investors. 4.

      "content": "For context I work in a hospital with a 100 ICU beds and no unit not even CTICU or CVICU has their own 12-lead ecg machine. Turnaround time for a stat 12-lead can be in the next 5 minutes or I’ve seen up to an hour. 12-leads in our inpatient setting is performed by techs that cover the whole hospital and there are times when we call and they say that they’re short staffed. When they come they don’t stay for long so any kind of arrhythmias that are transient often don’t get captured. They often get annoyed if you ask them to stay and wait. I ask this question because the skill and time necessary to do a 12-lead in a more critical setting can definitely be done by ICU nurses. I’m trying to find literature specific to this but everything just points to 12-leads in the ED or pre-hospital. I want to propose to our management that patient outcome would improve if we test piloted having ICU nurses do 12-leads in their own units instead of relying on techs.",

I have no interest in milking these patients for cash, but I can't shake the expectation from the hospitalists that I take part in this behavior.\n\nI'm sure I can't change \"the system\" but I sure would like to not be an active participant in something that just feels wrong.

One person had heard it will dye your liver, the other heard it will dye the inside of your colon.\n\nSomebody in Scotland must have done a colonoscopy after drinking a bunch of Irnbru as part of the prep.

But how many of us get sick (ie with viral illness) bad enough to knock us on our ass and have to lay in the bed for days?\n\nI feel fortunate, yet baffled, that I can see 10-20 patients a day in a small poorly ventilated room 40 hours a week, and rarely get sick.  Even if I get Covid or something, once I didn’t even notice (maybe thought I was tired from work and had allergies)  and it was an incidental finding on a required weekly swab. The other time I was laid out but only for a day.\n\nI feel very fortunate but I do think a decade of being around 80ish sick people a week just in my patient room, along with a bunch of coworkers also exposed, and riding public transit must have built immunity. Let me look for some positivity to this situation lol",

Hakeem Jeffries has been speaking on the floor for six hours in an effort to delay the final vote.\n\n***\n\nPLEASE CONSIDER CALLING your representative in an effort TO STOP THIS BILL.\n\nCall the Capitol Switchboard and ask them to connect you to the office of your House of Representatives member: 202-224-3121.\n\n***\n\nHERE IS A SCRIPT:\n\nHello, my name is [NAME], I am a [HEALTHCARE WORKER] and one of Representative [NAME OF REP]'s constituents in [DISTRICT ##]. I’m calling to express my opposition to the One Big Beautiful Bill currently before Congress.\n\nI’m deeply concerned that this bill will harm rural communities in our district. Several rural hospitals within an hour of Chico are considered “at risk” according to the Cecil G. Sheps Center at UNC. These hospitals are lifelines for our residents, and cuts to Medicaid and Medicare in this bill could push them closer to closure.\n\nLow-income, working families in our district already struggle to access care. Taking money away from poor families to fund tax cuts for the wealthy is wrong. This bill would further burden our most vulnerable neighbors and jeopardize health care access for rural residents.\n\nI urge Representative [NAME] to oppose the One Big Beautiful Bill unless it protects Medicaid funding and safeguards our rural hospitals. Please stand up for working families and the health of our community.\n\nHere is my address: [ADDRESS]\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Against all recommendations for rehabilitation after hospital stay OR home care ( he said he won't stay home to comply). Hospitalist does not want him driving.  OT did vision testing and recommended no driving. It is documented clearly in all of our notes what his impairments are. I was speaking to the hospitalist and told the patients biggest goal was to go home and be able to drive to the Casino daily.  The hospitalist said all he could do was recommend no driving and that was all he could do.  Then HE asked me what he should do. (new attending).  I haven't a clue. I believe he did eventually talk to another attending about it.   I suggested he discuss with case management also.  The patient did have  county case worker. Now even if DMV is notified, people are gonna probably try to drive. Hospitalists said it wasn't his role to notify DMV but the patients PCP (but he does not have one) This gentleman in particular would likely be such a person to just drive with double vision regardless if DMV temporarily suspends his license.\n\nWhat typically happens in such situations from hospital setting?\n\nTBH, makes me so much more worried about impaired drivers!!!",

This is the entrepreneur subreddit not investing. There isn't anything wrong with investing. It is just way better to invest as an entrepreneur. (Put 5k per month into index funds rather than 5k per year with a career)\n\n4. They got rich from starting and selling a business or buying and selling a business. \n\nThis is assuming action is taken after reading the book.",

            "content": "Been investing in stocks for the last 13 years. I recently calculated my returns and my CAGR is approximately 20% over 12 years. The S&P500 was 12% during the same period. \n\nI hit on some big winners like AAPL, CMG and NET. I held a very concentrated portfolio. Early on I was 70% AAPL. Then I diversified into more companies to lower risk. \n\nI’m thinking of quitting stocks and just going all in ETF. It takes a considerable amount of time to research and keep up with a dozen or so companies. And something is telling me I got damn lucky. \n\nIf I continue to strongly out perform the market the next 5-10 years it could make a big difference. But I could also get crushed for having a highly concentrated portfolio. I don’t like to hold more than 20 or so companies. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation and just cashed in your chips and went 100% etf? \n\nAt this point I don’t really enjoy the grind of investing in individual stocks. It is purely for profit. \n\nDid think about going mostly etf and some stocks. But won’t make much sense since it will take just as much time to do research on a smaller stock portfolio ",

Would you guys recommend just investing directly from my HYSA into 1 month T-Bills to utilize the higher APY? I’ve done it once or twice but I’m hesitant to make it a regular thing since obviously when the payment gets made to the Treasury I won’t have the money anymore, and I can’t really demand it back, which kind of defeats the point of an emergency fund. But I want to utilize that higher APY, if possible. Any suggestions?",

I would like to take it into my own hands.\n\nWould the series 65 be a good start? I had thought about SlE exam.. but I studied finance and it's all pretty high level info. I had thought a few years back in college that I would want to be an advisor. I would pay out of pocket to get the 65 exam prep + test. They most likely won't sponsor me.\n\nAny thoughts? \n\nI know I could job hop, but I don't know where I want to go or do, hoping certs could open my eyes + possibly boost my earning potential? Maybe I'm not thinking correctly.",

I find myself most actively managing my non-retirement account (because it’s much bigger) and just letting my Roth IRA sit there with index funds like VTI and VOO, while I have stocks like HOOD, TSLA, BITO, etc in my non-retirement brokerage where I do more transactions there.

The S&P500 was 12% during the same period. \n\nI hit on some big winners like AAPL, CMG and NET. I held a very concentrated portfolio. Early on I was 70% AAPL. Then I diversified into more companies to lower risk. \n\nI’m thinking of quitting stocks and just going all in ETF. It takes a considerable amount of time to research and keep up with a dozen or so companies. And something is telling me I got damn lucky. \n\nIf I continue to strongly out perform the market the next 5-10 years it could make a big difference. But I could also get crushed for having a highly concentrated portfolio. I don’t like to hold more than 20 or so companies. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation and just cashed in your chips and went 100% etf? \n\nAt this point I don’t really enjoy the grind of investing in individual stocks. It is purely for profit. \n\nDid think about going mostly etf and some stocks. But won’t make much sense since it will take just as much time to do research on a smaller stock portfolio ",

Looking at the current administration's actions, the trade deficits, and our sovereign debt levels, the USD must weaken.   How to short the USD? (Do I short UUP or go long puts UUP, or long a forex pair like CAD/USD OR EU/USD?)\n2. LT USG bonds will rise in yield. How to short LT USG bonds? (Do I short TLT or go long puts TLT?) \n3. Thus, housing market will soften substantially.  How to short that? (Really stumped on this one.  Do I go short a MREIT like NLY?)\n4. When Jerome Powell is replaced, which he will be, and sooner or later the front end of the curve will go down.  Short term rates will lower.  How to profit on that?  (Also stumped on this one.  Do I go short SGOV or TFLO?  Or do I need a product with more duration like up to what...3 yrs?)",

Meanwhile, the fund itself continues to go up just as the S&P would.\n\nThis is how I understand it and it seems too good to be true but I wanted to see if anybody had any experience with it. The advisory fee would likely be .4% with minimum 100k buy in.\n\nIs it worth it to buy into one of these accounts and harvest losses so I can sell some of my individual brokerage positions or should I just continue to invest in the S&P?  I have no other way to lower my taxes if I were to ever sell these positions.",

            "content": "I’m just wondering what’s the best practice here - for speculative investments (such as HOOD), would you put them in Roth IRA or a non-retirement brokerage account? Should Roth IRA just hold index funds for long-term growth or should it hold the more aggressive investments to take full advantage of the tax advantages? I find myself most actively managing my non-retirement account (because it’s much bigger) and just letting my Roth IRA sit there with index funds like VTI and VOO, while I have stocks like HOOD, TSLA, BITO, etc in my non-retirement brokerage where I do more transactions there. Should I be doing the opposite? Like do index funds in non-retirement account and aggressive investments in Roth IRA?",

The S&P500 was 12% during the same period. \n\nI hit on some big winners like AAPL, CMG and NET. I held a very concentrated portfolio. Early on I was 70% AAPL. Then I diversified into more companies to lower risk. \n\nI’m thinking of quitting stocks and just going all in ETF. It takes a considerable amount of time to research and keep up with a dozen or so companies. And something is telling me I got damn lucky. \n\nIf I continue to strongly out perform the market the next 5-10 years it could make a big difference. But I could also get crushed for having a highly concentrated portfolio. I don’t like to hold more than 20 or so companies. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation and just cashed in your chips and went 100% etf? \n\nAt this point I don’t really enjoy the grind of investing in individual stocks. It is purely for profit. \n\nDid think about going mostly etf and some stocks. But won’t make much sense since it will take just as much time to do research on a smaller stock portfolio ",

            "content": "I am a salaried employee in the People and culture department (ICS) with perfect evaluation record and was let go today after 3 years. I know of at least 4 more people in my department being laid off. Not sure if its happening in ECS as well. Reasoning: Moving roles to INDUS. My circumstances was very shady. They are doing it 2 weeks before bonus conversations and keeping it hostage unless I stay for a certain amount of time and help their new indus hires with knowledge transfer. They are ruthless. When I joined there was a sense of care about employees and it all went to shit after their mountain capital deal.\n\nUpdate: Just a clarification I am not in HR. I was in Learning technology and helped train Audit, Advisory and sometimes tax people, lots of intern programs and also fundemantal knowledge trainings (SAP, Tax code, all the software they use). Rolled out 100s of trainings. I am a tech guy and a power user in a lot of software they use thats why they want me to train their new peeps.",

A Fidelity rep reached out to me and pitched the idea of a tax loss harvesting SMA. \n\nIt seemed very convincing where it essentially tracks the S&P but harvest tax losses so if I wanted to sell some of my positions, it would offset those losses. Meanwhile, the fund itself continues to go up just as the S&P would.\n\nThis is how I understand it and it seems too good to be true but I wanted to see if anybody had any experience with it. The advisory fee would likely be .4% with minimum 100k buy in.\n\nIs it worth it to buy into one of these accounts and harvest losses so I can sell some of my individual brokerage positions or should I just continue to invest in the S&P?  I have no other way to lower my taxes if I were to ever sell these positions.",

They are doing it 2 weeks before bonus conversations and keeping it hostage unless I stay for a certain amount of time and help their new indus hires with knowledge transfer. They are ruthless. When I joined there was a sense of care about employees and it all went to shit after their mountain capital deal.\n\nUpdate: Just a clarification I am not in HR. I was in Learning technology and helped train Audit, Advisory and sometimes tax people, lots of intern programs and also fundemantal knowledge trainings (SAP, Tax code, all the software they use). Rolled out 100s of trainings. I am a tech guy and a power user in a lot of software they use thats why they want me to train their new peeps.",

This is compounded by strict productivity tracking, forcing them to 'act busy' and causing immense paranoia and stress. The core problem is the severe inefficiency in task allocation, workload management, and employee utilization within organizations, especially those with productivity monitoring.",

      "proposedSolution": "An AI-powered intelligent task allocation and workload management system. This system would: 1) Dynamically analyze employee skills, availability, and system access levels. 2) Monitor incoming tasks, project needs, and organizational priorities. 3) Proactively suggest optimal task assignments to managers, considering employee workload, skill development, and business needs. 4) Provide real-time transparency on task queues and employee utilization, reducing the need for 'acting busy' and fostering a culture of trust. 5) Identify skill gaps or underutilized employees for targeted training or new assignments.",
      "marketContext": "Many organizations struggle with efficient workload distribution, leading to both employee burnout and underutilization. The rise of remote work and increased use of productivity tracking tools exacerbate the problem, creating a high-stress environment where employees feel pressured to appear busy even when they lack assigned tasks.",

After that I bounced around a little bit trying different accounting roles. I’m currently an internal auditor at a public company. At every job I’ve had I’ve had pretty severe imposter syndrome, anxiety, and overall low self confidence in myself and my work. I constantly compare myself to others and see how much better/smarter/driven they are. I don’t like speaking up in meetings or in general because of the fear that I will sound ignorant to my peers. I just constantly find myself in a spiral of negative thoughts. All of this and I’ve never had any negative comments from superiors. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me… Although I’m sure I can trace some of these issues back to my childhood and how I was raised. \n\nAnyway, I’m just curious if anyone else has similar issues within accounting, audit, business, or life in general. Or maybe it’s just me and I need severe help. ",

They are doing it 2 weeks before bonus conversations and keeping it hostage unless I stay for a certain amount of time and help their new indus hires with knowledge transfer. They are ruthless. When I joined there was a sense of care about employees and it all went to shit after their mountain capital deal.\n\nUpdate: Just a clarification I am not in HR. I was in Learning technology and helped train Audit, Advisory and sometimes tax people, lots of intern programs and also fundemantal knowledge trainings (SAP, Tax code, all the software they use). Rolled out 100s of trainings. I am a tech guy and a power user in a lot of software they use thats why they want me to train their new peeps.",

The core problem is the overwhelming volume of repetitive, time-consuming tasks that cannot be completed within standard working hours, leading to burnout and high employee turnover.",

This platform would leverage AI and machine learning to automate highly repetitive and time-consuming tasks such as data entry from various sources (receipts, bank statements), reconciliation of accounts, document classification and organization, preliminary audit checks, and automated generation of routine financial reports and tax forms. The goal is to significantly reduce the manual workload during peak seasons, allowing firms to manage their workload more efficiently without excessive overtime.",

Dang\" humorously highlights a common and frustrating problem for job seekers: encountering job descriptions with unrealistic, exaggerated, or seemingly impossible experience requirements (e.g., asking for decades of experience for a mid-level role, or highly specific, niche skills that are rarely found together). This leads to confusion, self-doubt, and wasted time for job seekers trying to determine if they are truly qualified or if the requirements are merely aspirational.",
      "currentSolution": null,
      "proposedSolution": "An AI-powered \"Job Requirement Translator & Matcher\" for job seekers. This tool would allow users to paste a job description and their resume, and the AI would: 1) Analyze the job requirements, identifying common exaggerations or 'wish list' items. 2) Interpret the true intent behind vague or overly specific requirements. 3) Compare the user's resume against the interpreted requirements, highlighting actual skill matches and suggesting how to frame their experience to better fit the role. 4) Provide a confidence score for the user's fit, helping them decide whether to apply and how to tailor their application.",
      "marketContext": "The job market is often opaque, with job descriptions frequently containing inflated or unrealistic requirements. This creates significant friction for job seekers who struggle to understand if they are truly qualified for roles, leading to widespread frustration and inefficiency in the hiring process.",

This platform would: 1) Analyze a student's learning style, strengths, and weaknesses to create a highly personalized study path. 2) Dynamically recommend optimal learning resources (e.g., concise summaries, targeted video clips, interactive simulations, practice questions) instead of generic, lengthy videos. 3) Use AI to summarize long video lectures or notes into digestible formats. 4) Provide intelligent practice questions with detailed, AI-generated explanations tailored to the student's specific misconceptions. 5) Track progress and predict exam readiness, minimizing burnout and maximizing study efficiency.",

This indicates a strong demand for highly curated, credible, and actionable entrepreneurial guidance.",

The AI would analyze author backgrounds, publication history, and content themes to filter out undesirable sources and highlight genuinely impactful advice.",
      "marketContext": "The entrepreneurial education market is saturated with advice, but there's a significant trust deficit due to prevalent 'guru' culture and get-rich-quick schemes.

            "content": "I am currently at a fintech startup that has gained significant traction. I was a very early employee (first 10) and am near the top of the org chart.\n\nWe recently closed a large funding round, and our revenue is growing.\n\nThe issue is – I am burnt out. The stress has taken a toll on my physical and mental health. I thought I could tough it out, but it seems to get harder with each week. I know I need to leave at some point soon, for the sake of myself and my family.\n\nIn the lead up to funding, I was given strong signals that sales via a secondary would be available, but unfortunately this was only the case for the founder. Obviously this was very disappointing to myself.\n\nI have been here for over 7 years, and am not sure if I can make it another 2 until the next potential round (if there is one at all) or to some unknown liquidity event. My ideal scenario would be a clean break from the company including liquidation of my stock.\n\nI have a decent amount of equity (not a founder sized grant, but fourth on the cap table) and it is fully vested and fully early exercised. The cash value of the equity based on our 409a based FMV is over 2M, The equity value based on the round is over 10M. Either way, this is life changing money for me.\n\nWhat leverage, if any, do I have when leaving?\n\nWould it be possible to sell back my shares to the company at FMV on the way out?\n\nWould it make more sense to leave completely amicably, and then reach out to the founder or the investors directly to buy me out at FMV?\n\nI thought about 3rd party sales, but the company has the right of first refusal. Does anyone have experience with this, I can imagine it’s likely easiest to just deny the sale outright?\n\nI know the common advice is to talk to a lawyer, which I will, but if you could provide advice on what kind of lawyer I am looking for that would be very helpful.",

      "description": "Entrepreneurs and founders often feel immense pressure to engage in self-promotion and personal branding on social media platforms like X and LinkedIn. However, many find this process inauthentic, performative, and anxiety-inducing, leading to a strong aversion to marketing themselves. They prefer to focus on building products and feel that current social media demands force them into a role they dislike, causing significant emotional discomfort and inefficiency.",
      "currentSolution": null,
      "proposedSolution": "An AI-powered content generation and scheduling tool that creates authentic, personalized, and engaging social media content for founders. This solution would analyze a founder's work, projects, and natural communication style to generate posts that genuinely reflect their values and activities, eliminating the need for them to actively 'perform' or feel inauthentic. It would automate content creation, scheduling, and potentially even engagement, allowing founders to maintain a strong online presence without the associated emotional burden.",
      "marketContext": "The increasing pressure on professionals and entrepreneurs to maintain a strong online presence and personal brand, coupled with the rapid advancements in AI content generation, creates a significant opportunity for tools that bridge the gap between this necessity and the widespread personal aversion to self-promotion.",
      "implementationNotes": "Focus on natural language generation (NLG) capable of adapting to individual user styles and tones. Implement robust user-style adaptation and ethical AI use to ensure authenticity. Requires seamless integration with major social media platforms (X, LinkedIn, etc.).",

All these \"thought leaders\" posting their humble brags and inspirational quotes... ugh.\n\nBut apparently this is how you're supposed to succeed now? Just constantly posting about yourself?\n\nSo for those of you who also hate this shit:\n\n- ⁠how do you actually feel about having to promote yourself? does it make you want to die inside too?\n- have you found any ways to do it that don't feel completely soul-crushing?\n- did you get over the anxiety somehow or do you just power through feeling like crap?\n- is there actually another way to grow a business without becoming a linkedin influencer?\n\nI'm starting to think maybe I'm just not cut out for this whole entrepreneur thing if I can't even handle basic self-promotion. But there's gotta be other people who feel this way right?\n\nanyone else just want to build cool stuff without having to be a marketing machine?",

Quit and decided to start some software company (didn't have a problem space at the time nor am I a domain expert in anything - but thought I can figure it out)\n3. Some time passed and still couldn't figure out a problem space, and I realized building the software itself is not my thing. I realized I enjoy being the domain expert, not the knee-deep technical guy in building out solutions.\n4. Got interested in AI automation using n8n.\n5. Started pitching my solution and providing free automations for a few clients\n6. Have been doing that till now (just 2 months in) - but a common theme I see amongst my clients is that the solution is a NICE TO HAVE solution, not a painpoint.\n7. Losing confidence in AI automation agency as a business model in where I live.\n8. An anology is there are 2 kind of gym trainers: 1) the type that the moment you see them, you know they are devoted to their craft; 2) those that gets a cert just so they can get a job in a gym... I feel like I am the latter when it comes to AI automation agency\n9. So now I am figuring out my next steps. I know that I lack both domain and technical expertise. I want to get domain expertise.\n10. My options are: i. Join a good startup and learn the ways to run one - and hopefully identify a problem space that I am interested in solving during that time. ii. Continue what I'm doing in AI automation - dont give up because so far I have realized none of my visions that I have set for myself when quitting my full time job, and keep talking to customers and exploring other opportunities that I won't have domain expertise in.\n\nFor those who have went through something similar, would really appreciate your advice.

This model allows top experts to monetize their time efficiently and provides startups with rapid access to precise, high-quality advice without the commitment of a full accelerator program or long-term mentorship.",
      "marketContext": "The startup ecosystem's heavy reliance on mentorship often faces challenges with inconsistent quality. Providing a direct, efficient, and monetized channel for top experts to share their specialized knowledge in a flexible way could revolutionize how startups access critical advice and accelerate their growth.",
      "implementationNotes": "Requires a robust expert vetting process to ensure quality. The AI for problem understanding and matching needs to be highly accurate. Seamless scheduling, secure communication, and efficient payment processing are essential. Consideration for how to incentivize top-tier experts to participate in micro-consultations.",

They lack clear paths for secondary sales, are unsure about their leverage, and need guidance on legal and financial aspects (e.g., company's right of first refusal, valuation discrepancies). The core problem is the illiquidity and complexity of exiting with vested startup equity.",
      "currentSolution": null,
      "proposedSolution": "An AI-powered platform that serves as a private secondary marketplace for vested startup equity, specifically for early employees and non-founder executives. The platform would: 1) Provide AI-driven valuation insights (based on 409a, recent funding rounds, and market comparables). 2) Facilitate secure connections between sellers and potential buyers (institutional investors, funds, or even the company itself). 3) Offer AI-assisted guidance on navigating legal complexities like Right of First Refusal (ROFR) and generating initial transaction documents. 4) Provide strategic advice on optimal timing and negotiation tactics based on market data. This would streamline the entire exit process, offering a 'clean break' and maximizing liquidity.",
      "marketContext": "The trend of startups staying private longer means more employees accumulate significant illiquid equity, creating a growing demand for secondary liquidity solutions beyond traditional IPOs or acquisitions.

            "content": "I am currently at a fintech startup that has gained significant traction. I was a very early employee (first 10) and am near the top of the org chart.\n\nWe recently closed a large funding round, and our revenue is growing.\n\nThe issue is – I am burnt out. The stress has taken a toll on my physical and mental health. I thought I could tough it out, but it seems to get harder with each week. I know I need to leave at some point soon, for the sake of myself and my family.\n\nIn the lead up to funding, I was given strong signals that sales via a secondary would be available, but unfortunately this was only the case for the founder. Obviously this was very disappointing to myself.\n\nI have been here for over 7 years, and am not sure if I can make it another 2 until the next potential round (if there is one at all) or to some unknown liquidity event. My ideal scenario would be a clean break from the company including liquidation of my stock.\n\nI have a decent amount of equity (not a founder sized grant, but fourth on the cap table) and it is fully vested and fully early exercised. The cash value of the equity based on our 409a based FMV is over 2M, The equity value based on the round is over 10M. Either way, this is life changing money for me.\n\nWhat leverage, if any, do I have when leaving?\n\nWould it be possible to sell back my shares to the company at FMV on the way out?\n\nWould it make more sense to leave completely amicably, and then reach out to the founder or the investors directly to buy me out at FMV?\n\nI thought about 3rd party sales, but the company has the right of first refusal. Does anyone have experience with this, I can imagine it’s likely easiest to just deny the sale outright?\n\nI know the common advice is to talk to a lawyer, which I will, but if you could provide advice on what kind of lawyer I am looking for that would be very helpful.",

            "content": "1. 3 years in management consulting\n2. Quit and decided to start some software company (didn't have a problem space at the time nor am I a domain expert in anything - but thought I can figure it out)\n3. Some time passed and still couldn't figure out a problem space, and I realized building the software itself is not my thing. I realized I enjoy being the domain expert, not the knee-deep technical guy in building out solutions.\n4. Got interested in AI automation using n8n.\n5. Started pitching my solution and providing free automations for a few clients\n6. Have been doing that till now (just 2 months in) - but a common theme I see amongst my clients is that the solution is a NICE TO HAVE solution, not a painpoint.\n7. Losing confidence in AI automation agency as a business model in where I live.\n8. An anology is there are 2 kind of gym trainers: 1) the type that the moment you see them, you know they are devoted to their craft; 2) those that gets a cert just so they can get a job in a gym... I feel like I am the latter when it comes to AI automation agency\n9. So now I am figuring out my next steps. I know that I lack both domain and technical expertise. I want to get domain expertise.\n10. My options are: i. Join a good startup and learn the ways to run one - and hopefully identify a problem space that I am interested in solving during that time. ii. Continue what I'm doing in AI automation - dont give up because so far I have realized none of my visions that I have set for myself when quitting my full time job, and keep talking to customers and exploring other opportunities that I won't have domain expertise in.\n\nFor those who have went through something similar, would really appreciate your advice. Thank you!",

            "content": "I am currently at a fintech startup that has gained significant traction. I was a very early employee (first 10) and am near the top of the org chart.\n\nWe recently closed a large funding round, and our revenue is growing.\n\nThe issue is – I am burnt out. The stress has taken a toll on my physical and mental health. I thought I could tough it out, but it seems to get harder with each week. I know I need to leave at some point soon, for the sake of myself and my family.\n\nIn the lead up to funding, I was given strong signals that sales via a secondary would be available, but unfortunately this was only the case for the founder. Obviously this was very disappointing to myself.\n\nI have been here for over 7 years, and am not sure if I can make it another 2 until the next potential round (if there is one at all) or to some unknown liquidity event. My ideal scenario would be a clean break from the company including liquidation of my stock.\n\nI have a decent amount of equity (not a founder sized grant, but fourth on the cap table) and it is fully vested and fully early exercised. The cash value of the equity based on our 409a based FMV is over 2M, The equity value based on the round is over 10M. Either way, this is life changing money for me.\n\nWhat leverage, if any, do I have when leaving?\n\nWould it be possible to sell back my shares to the company at FMV on the way out?\n\nWould it make more sense to leave completely amicably, and then reach out to the founder or the investors directly to buy me out at FMV?\n\nI thought about 3rd party sales, but the company has the right of first refusal. Does anyone have experience with this, I can imagine it’s likely easiest to just deny the sale outright?\n\nI know the common advice is to talk to a lawyer, which I will, but if you could provide advice on what kind of lawyer I am looking for that would be very helpful.",

            "title": "Built a BI Tool and now company wants me to bring it internal...",
            "content": "So I work in a Sales position in the e-commerce department of a large hydraulics distributor.  A little while ago I built a tool that scrapes our biggest competitors e-commerce storefront twice a day, dumps that data to a DB and then serves that up on a nice dashboard behind authentication.   Dashboard allows you to select a date range to filter by and displays the estimated revenue for the time period, a paginated table with every single part and its price, quantity sold, restocked, current quantity on hand etc.  You can also filter it by column and export the entire thing to excel.  It also shows the top 10 sold and top 10 restock units.\n\nAnyways over time this data is going to prove very valuable to the company because it will allow them to adjust stock purchases to match what the competitor is selling.  \n\nAnyways jump to today and my boss comes in my office...  he goes on to say that it would make more sense to have the dashboard and database be served on an \"internal\" server and goes on to talk about my hiring contract and the restrictive covenant clause.  He says that anything I build on company time even if on my own PC is owned by the company.  I scoffed and said I dont remember seeing anything like that and low and behold when I go check all it says is I cant sell or solicit to any of the companies clients for 1 year after I leave.  So no.  The cynic in me feels he wants to get rid of me because I have just started a divorce process and he feels like im a burden needing time to handle things.  But the worst part is I dont want to give away this system for free seeing as how valuable to them it will be.\n\nIm looking for advice on how people here would handle this if they were in the same situation.\n\nThanks!",
